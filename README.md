# Discord-Chatbot
A chatbot is an automated conversation partner. It facilitates a conversation between a human and a computer. Usually, when you have a conversation, you are talking to another human. But with chatbots, you are not talking to a human, but to a computer that can automatically talk back based on your questions and answers.
